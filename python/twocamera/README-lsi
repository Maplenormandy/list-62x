Implementation of the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm for 2d line segment intersection.

See:
de Berg et al., Ch. 2
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley-Ottmann_algorithm

for more information.

Usage:

from lsi import intersection

# S is a list of tuples of the form: ((x,y), (x,y))
i = intersection(S)

This function returns a dictionary of intersection points (keys) and a list of their associated segments (values).


Currently, this implementation does not handle horizontal/vertical line segments. This will be changed shortly!

A test file is available. It compares the running time of the algorithm to that of a brute-force O(N^2) comparison. It also generates a specified number of random input segments--you can set the precision and range by editing the file.
